  <h2>Sun Wu</h2>
  <p>Sun Wu or better known as Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn period, he was active as a general and strategist, serving king Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven nations – Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan – who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China .Sun Tzu was tasked with training an army of 30,000 to fight an army 10 times as large, a challenge that is thought to be impossible. The Art of War would be proven on the battle in the years to follow. </p>

  <p>The Art of War was a book written by Sun Tzu, it is comprised of tactics/guide lines for a fighting force. Think of each chapter as a strong string, but once you put them all together you have an unbreakable rope.</p><br/><br/>
